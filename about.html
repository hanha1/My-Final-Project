<p><b>PHILOSOPHY OF INSTRUCTION </b></p><br>
      <p>The SBCBS Online Bible School is designed to provide students with an online, comprehensive, in-depth study of the Bible. The lessons are pure non-denominational teaching based on an accurate "drawing out" of what the Bible teaches, not reading into the text what someone might think it teaches. The courses cover every book in the Bible, plus four additional subjects which help you in your understanding of the scriptures (Christian Evidences, Hermeneutics, Greek and The Bible from God to Us). The school is designed for anyone who wants a focused, organized and thorough study of the Bible.</p><br><br>

  <p><b>HISTORY ABOUT WVBS </b></p><br>
  <p>By God’s grace Southern Baptist Church® SBCBS) came into existence in late 1986. After several years of recording Bible courses there was enough excellent curriculum available to begin an in-depth correspondence school. Our desire was to teach anyone who seriously wanted to study the Bible in a structured environment. The need has now arisen to reestablish the correspondence school as an online Bible school under the name SBCBS Bible School. There are thousands of Bible schools, churches and individuals at the present time around the world that are using SBCBS materials as a part of their curriculum.</p><br><br>
   <p><b>ABOUT THE INSTRUCTORS </b></p><br>
  <p>All the instructors in the school have had years of study and have prepared themselves to teach these subjects. Each instructor is presently, or has been, an instructor in a Bible training school. They are among the finest teachers available today. The level of education is equal to, and even far superior to what many colleges or seminaries provide. Any graduate of the school will be fully qualified to teach the Bible to others.</p><br><br>
   <p><b>ABOUT THE DIRECTOR </b></p><br>
  <p>The Director of the School is Russell Haffner. He is an alumnus of Texas A&M University in College Station, where he majored in Environmental Design. He graduated from the Southwest School of Bible Studies in 1993. He has served as a minister of the gospel for 26 years. He has spoken on various lectureships and held several gospel meetings. He also has published articles in numerous books.</p><br><br>
